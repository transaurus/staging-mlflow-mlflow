## Production Readiness[​](#production-readiness "Direct link to Production Readiness")

MLflow Tracing is production ready and provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities for your LLM applications and AI agents in production environments. By enabling [async logging](/docs/latest/genai/tracing/prod-tracing.md#asynchronous-trace-logging), trace logging is done in the background and does not impact the performance of your application.

For production deployments, it is recommended to use the [Production Tracing SDK](/docs/latest/genai/tracing/lightweight-sdk.md) (`mlflow-tracing`) that is optimized for reducing the total installation size and minimizing dependencies while maintaining full tracing capabilities. Compared to the full `mlflow` package, the `mlflow-tracing` package requires 95% smaller footprint.

Read [Production Monitoring](/docs/latest/genai/tracing/prod-tracing.md) for complete guidance on using MLflow Tracing for monitoring models in production and various backend configuration options.
